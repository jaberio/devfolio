## Essential Tools

1. **Next.js & React**: Still the kings of the frontend ecosystem for performance and DX.
2. **AI Pair Programming**: Leveraging agents to handle boilerplate and complex refactors.
3. **YAML-Driven Content**: Keeping data and code separated for maximum flexibility.

### The Philosophy
