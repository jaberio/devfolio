# The Art of Minimalism

In technical design, clarity is king. By removing unnecessary decorative elements, we allow the content (your code and projects) to take center stage.

## Principles of Minimalist UI

- **Intentional Negative Space**: Giving elements room to breathe.
- **Strong Typography**: Using hierarchy and weight instead of colors to guide the user's eye.
- **Hidden Complexity**: Keeping advanced options tucked away while making primary actions obvious.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

This portfolio aims to embody these principles through its clean repo cards and focused layout.
