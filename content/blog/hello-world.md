# Welcome to my new blog!

This is the first post of my developer portfolio. I built this site to be modular and easy to maintain.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: For the core framework and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid styling.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety.
- **YAML**: For easy configuration.

```typescript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
